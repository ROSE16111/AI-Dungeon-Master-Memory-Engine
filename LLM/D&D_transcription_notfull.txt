 Alright, that's weird. I do not like the sound of my own voice, so I wish I wasn't recording. Okay, so how it starts out. Okay, so there you guys have arrived into town. You've arrived into town. You're a group of adventurers looking for a new job to do because you're a bit short on cash and you need some money to buy some new adventuring gear. Alright, so you arrive into town and you're walking into town and you're looking around and you're thinking, oh, you know, where are we going to find a job? Where are we going to find someone who's going to pay us some good money for our adventuring skills? What would you like to do? You could maybe go to the pub and see if anybody at the pub has a job. You can see maybe look around town and see if there's a message board with jobs on the message board. What would you like to do? Can I steal someone's money? You can? If you wish? Yeah. Yeah. Who would you like to steal from? Who doesn't money? How would you know? Okay. So while he's looking around to see if he can steal someone's money, would you guys like to look for somebody who has a job? Maybe we can ask others. Beautiful. Resident in a town. Yeah. So you see someone walking down the street. It's a nice old man, has a little cane and he's walking down the street and you call out and you go, Hi, we're looking for a job. Yeah. And he's like, I know I've just the job. If you go down the street down here, there's a brewing company, a company that makes beer. And I know that the owner of this brewing company, Glove, killed him. He's been having a trouble with rats. He has rats in his basement and he can't find anyone to kill these rats. I bet if you go ask him, he'll get you to kill the rats and you'll be able to make a good amount of money. So is there anyone selling cats in a cat? Selling what? Cats. Do you want to go and have a look to see if anyone's selling any cats? Because I need to solve the rats. You can kill the rats yourself if you want. So yeah, what I would recommend now is maybe going and asking Glove Kindle if you can have the job. Yeah. So would you guys like to go to the brewing company? Yes. Oh, company always has money. Yes. Yes. Perfect. Yeah. Are you still looking for somebody to rob? No. No, okay. He shows his money. Well, you know what? You can always rob someone later if you wish. Oh. Okay. So you follow the directions the old man gave you and you've trudged about a mile or two out of town along an old dirt road that winds its way up the hill. As you near the top, a large stone building comes into view flanked by a couple of barns. So like, you know, barns where they keep cows and sheep. By the door is a brightly painted sign that reads the wizards tower brewing code for the freshest pint in town. So you've arrived at the pub at the brewing company. What do you do? Do you knock on the door? Um, as a sneaker, round the pub and find the small door. You're going to, you're going to go round to the back door? Yeah. Okay. Are you going to knock on the back door? Yeah, you're going to knock on the back door. Okay. Do you guys go with it? No, no, no, you guys stay at the front door. Okay. Do you knock on the front door? Yeah. I think I want you to. Yeah. You want to knock it on the back door and you're knocking on the front door. Okay. So you both knock at the same time and you hear one second and then someone's like coming running to the front door and he opens the door and he's like, one moment please, there's someone also at the back door and he goes running around and he opens the back door and he's like, one second, sorry, someone's at the front door and he comes running back and he's like, oh, I've never been so busy before. Why is everybody knocking on all the doors? And he invites, he's like, come in, come in, come in. Um, are you guys here for a drink or why? How can I help you? Oh, you're looking for a job. Oh, you're looking for a job. Excellent. Excellent. I have just the job. You at the back door, why don't you come and join us? Are you guys all together? Yeah. No. No. Oh, two separate. What then why are you here? Um, Griff. Uh, I'm just walking around so I'm leaving now. You're leaving now? I'm leaving now. That's weird, but okay, goodbye. Yeah, and I'm not actually leaving. I'm going to sneak around the company. Okay, all right. So while he goes off to sneak around, I don't know why he's so sneaky. Um, he sends you guys, yeah, would you like a beer? Yeah. You'd like a beer? A beer for you? Yeah. Would you like a beer? Um, no. No, no beer for you. No, no problem. Would you like a beer? Tea. Wonderful. I do have very strange request at a beer company, but that's okay. I could make you a tea. So he goes off and he pours like a few beers and a beer for you, a beer for you, no beer for you, tea for you, and you'll sit down to have a bit of chat. And he's going to tell you about the job. Meanwhile, you are sneaky for some reason. Sneaky around the outside of the building. And I want you to roll stealth to see how sneaky you are. So roll the dice. And you've got 10. Now you add your stealth. So if you look at the skills, the big lot of skills here, if you go right down the bottom, here, stealth plus. So you got three. So it's 10 plus three. You have a stealth of 13. That's pretty good. So as you're sneaking around the building, nobody sees you. Wow. You're very stealthy. Can I go to the storage, the storage or the room they saw they appear? So you like the cellar, like the basement where they store all the casts of beer? Yes. So you see a cellar door. Do you want to try to go in the cellar door? Yeah. Okay. So now you're going to roll, slight of hand to try to pick the lock on the cellar door. So that's an 11. Now if you look, I think slight of hand is near the bottom, also three. So 11 plus three is 14. Unfortunately, that's not good enough. You can't pick that lock. That door stays locked. Can I smash the lock? You certainly can. You go, here's your dice. Roll your dice. Now, do you have a weapon that you can smash the door with? No, I'm armed. Unarmed. Okay. So you are punching the door for some reason. So, you always tell one could find him. So 14 and then you've got plus five to attack and then you do three damage. Now three damage is not very much. It's going to take quite a few punches to get through this door. Meanwhile, we return to the group having a nice drink inside, like reasonable people. Okay. So, Glock Hindle offers to explain what he needs. Okay. So, we're sitting inside the building. Now the entire building is infused with a smell of beer, but it's very clean and it's well organized. There's a few humans and a few halflings wondering about checking on the barrels and the vats of bubbling liquid. So they hand out the drinks to everyone who wants them. And Glock Hindle, he's a little known, by the way. Let me show you a little picture of a gnome. This is what Glock Hindle looks like. That's not a very big picture. Here we go. A little gnome. So he's about this tall. It's similar to me. Yes, same height as you, Mabel. You're the same height as Glock Hindle. Okay. So, he explains. The business has been doing very well and was looking to expand its operations. But in order to do this, first they need to expand their beer cellar, which is the cellar that he's currently trying to break into. He had some workmen down there, digging out an extra room when he uncovered an old wall. It's like it looks like an old ruin down in the cellar. Like he's dug it up and he's found this old ruin. And curious, they knocked a big hole in the wall only to be attacked by giant black rats. And he's like, the rats were as big as dogs. And you're looking at him and you're like, you're really small, dude. I don't think they're right. But anyway. So everyone who is down in the cellar managed to escape with a few cuts and bruises, but now the cellar is completely unusable. It's completely overwhelmed by rats. And if they want to get their production starting again, he needs the adventurers to deal with the giant rat infestation in the cellar. He's not sure where the rats came from, but the brewery took its name from an old wizards tower that used to be on the site. So it could have something to do with that. Alright, so he says to you guys, if you can go down and kill all the rats, I'm going to give you 25 gold pieces each. If you do the job, would you like to do the job? Yeah, yeah. Do you want more? Yeah, I think I'm rich, I don't need money. Your personality is rich. So maybe you say to go, Kindle, I think I deserve more for this. Do you have any fails? Oh, you want something else. Alright, so I'm going to get you to roll and you're going to roll persuasion to convince GlowKindle to give you a special prize. 9. And then you should have on your list, there should be persuasion. Here we go. You've actually got a plus four of persuasion, that's quite good. My persuasion is negative. Yes, you are not very convincing. I look forward to you talking your way out of the cellar breaking. You're all so negative. Can I make friends with that little guy? Yeah, you want to make friends with him? Yeah, absolutely. So you get to 9 plus four is 13. That's pretty convincing. That's not too bad. So he says, you know what? Just for you. So who's your character, Sally? And here's a palleted, wonderful. So just for you, actually, I did find this old sword when we were cleaning out, trying to clean out the ruins. It's actually quite cool. If you do the job, then I'll give you that sword as well as the 25 gold pieces. Okay, thank you. All right. And so would you like to try to make friends with him? Yeah. Beautiful. All right. Where did the dice go? Do you want to roll the dice? Yeah. You're also going to roll persuasion or straight charisma. You rolled a 12, you've got a plus one. You make a friendly joke to him, and you chat to him a little bit. And he's like, oh, you're so great. We're such a nice person to meet. I really love to be friends with you. He is another beer, if you'd like. And you get a free drink. Wonderful. Okay, so he lets you know he's like, everyone, if you just go down that way there, the stairs down to the cellar will just down there. So as soon as you finish up your drinks, if you'd like to get started on the job, that's great. I'm actually just going to go because I can hear a bit of a ruckus outside, and I'm just wondering what's happening out there. So I'm just going to go check on that, just one moment. And he goes bustling outside to check on what the noise is, which the noise is. Somebody who is still punching in the cellar door. So you're going to roll an unarmed punch attack. That's very soothing my personality. Yes, you are indeed rude and loud. Absolutely, too. Too, wonderful. You go to punch the door, and you completely miss, and you fall over and hit your face on the ground. You're not very good at punching this door. Would you like to try to punch it again? No. Okay. So Glowkindle comes out, he's like, excuse me, excuse me. Why are you trying to punch in my cellar door? It's going on. Can I attack him? Oh my god. Oh my god. You could. I would recommend, though, that there is a ton of people inside that will come rushing out to his defensive you do so, and you may die. It's a little bit early to die in the face, and I would recommend, like if we're going to play for two hours, you probably won't want to die 20 minutes in. Because you'll have to sit here while everybody else plays. Okay, can I join them to get rid of them? Absolutely. Can he's like, oh, you're part of that party. Come on, come on, come on. Oh, we don't know him. He's like, well, you know what, that's fine. That's fine. Oh, you go down the cellar, you go. I don't care if you're together, not together. Just kill the rats. Please kill the rats. Please kill the rats. That would be lovely. So, who goes off to do his job? He comes. And because you made friends with him, he high fives you on the way out. He loves his new buddy. Okay, so down to the cellar you go. The wooden stairs creak as you descend into the cool, dry air of the cellar, which is infused with the smell of beer and damp fur. Somewhere in the darkness you hear the scrabbling sound of claws on the floorboards, and I faint squeaking noise. Okay, so the cellar is completely dark, and much of the floor is taken up by barrels and casts of beer that make it hard to see the room. The only relatively clear area is towards the far side of the cellar, which has a dirt floor littered with stones and workmen's tools. Okay, so it's quite dark down here. And now I haven't written it on your character sheets, but some people can see and do the dark, and some people can't. So if you are a dwarf or an elf or a dragonborn, you can currently see perfectly well in the dark. If you are human, you can't see very well at all. So who can't see? Wonderful. So do you guys who can see, maybe can see, or a dwarf, and the elf can see, and the dragon can see, definitely. So do you guys help out your friends who can see? So you take their hands to make sure that they don't immediately fall over in the dark. Very nice. Okay. So those who can see in the dark, immediately notice the hole in the wall that was mentioned by Glow Kendall. Now that whole hole is about four feet by about three feet. It's pretty big. So you can see the hole in the wall. And what would you like to do? Meanwhile, I'm just going to let this slide. Now this is the map. A little bit hard to see, but sometimes we use maps so you can visualize. So you guys have just come walking down the stairs, and you're standing at the bottom of the stairs. You can see the hole in the wall in front of you. So what's behind that, yeah? So that might just help you visualize where you are. Wonderful. So what do you do? I'm going to shrink one out of the bed. You're going to shrink one out of this. Okay. Keep in mind that you currently can't see very well. So do you go wondering off into the dark by yourself? If I keep my mind, I just want to do this. I just want to shrink the field. You just want to drink the beer. You're going to go within to help him. Yeah. Good choice. Okay. So you guys go off to the side, maybe off to the side, to go to one of the cars to see if you can tap it and get drinks some of the beer. What do you guys do? I just want you to walk straight. You just want to walk straight to check out the hole? Yeah. Okay. Now. Do you want to get attacked? I think. Do you have a curse? Okay. I'm going to get you all to roll perception. Now, perception helps you see. Woo-hoo! Perception helps you determine how well you see. So you've got an 18 and then you add your perception score. It's really good. Oh, that's really good. That's a really good roll. Everybody's to roll. It'll tell you what everybody sees. Oh, no. Where's your perception? It's zero. Okay, so four. Two, even worse. Perception is three. Three, okay, five. Not two, bad. Do you guys want to roll? Two. You want to do it? Two. Zero. Ten. No, no. Three. Oh, no. You guys are just wondering what you're doing with the eye shot. I'm going to do it. Three. Oh, no. Three. Oh, no. You guys are just wondering what you're doing with the eye shot. Four. Okay, seven, not two, bad. All right. So, Valentin goes, oh, my goodness. This place is covered in rats and you guys are all like, where? Where? Because you can't see the rats. Okay, and you're, so now we're all going to roll initiative. Now, initiative tells me what you're going to do with the eye shot. It tells me what order you guys are going to be in combat. So, when we're in combat, everybody has a turn in order. So, I'm just going to grab my notebook out so I can write down the order. Now, your initiative score is this big one up the top. So, yours is plus one. So, yeah, once again, you roll your D20. And so, 13, so you've got 14. So, 14 for Mable. Oh, 16. Oh, okay, Griffith, 16. 11 plus for June initiative, but plus one maybe. 17. You're a good relic. Oh. You know, so 17 plus, oh, you added your two. 17, okay. And then Sheila was, what, sorry? 11. You got 11. 11. Okay, and now, if you give me back the dice, I'm going to roll for the rats to see when the rats have their turn. Hang on, I need to do some secret stuff over here. Okay. Yeah, finish my dream. Okay, so, Valentine, because you saw the rats, your quick off the mark straight away, you're like, oh, I can see them. What would you like to do? Kill them, wonderful. How would you like to? You've got your frost spell or you've got your sword. Now, if you use your frost spell, you can cast it from backwards, but if you use your sword, you're going to have to get up in amongst the rats. So you get one action per turn. Yeah. So I think I want to use the sword. The sword? Yeah, not a problem. So you first roll the D20 to see if your attack hits. You do plus four. Six. Six. No, unfortunately, you go rushing in with your sword, but you miss. Unfortunately. All right, the next person is Griff. What would you like to do? You have a bow or are you still drinking it? You can see the rats now because Valentine's Shatter. Look, rats. So you can see them now. And when you have a look, you see that there's three giant rats. And they're right here next to the opening. So you've still got a little bit of space. No, I have a bow. You have a bow, yeah. Would you like to shoot the rats? Yes, of course. Beautiful. Beautiful. You hit the rat. Okay. Now, in order to calculate your damage, you damage is your next one. So it says 1d8 plus 3. So I'm grabbing the d8. This is a d8. You roll that one. Plus 3. Six damage. The rat goes down. You're so busy drinking your beer. You're a bit drunk. You're spin around. You whip your bow out. You shoot it. Boom, straight through the eye and the rat dies. Straight on the ground. One rats down. Or right. The next person who goes are the rats. So it's their turn. So they just saw their friend being brutally murdered by an arrow. So they're a little bit afraid, but they're also like, oh, I'm going to get in there. I'm going to attack. So they come forward. And one races straight up to Griff, because you just saw him. Take a big chunk out of his friend. And then he attempts to bite you. So 19. What's your AC? 14. 14, yes. He does indeed bite you. And he makes a 1d4. Not yet. Not to your turn. Okay. One, he only does one damage. So let me point out here. This is your hit points 12. So take the pen. And now you're right down here that your hit points are at 11. Yeah. So not too bad. It's not too drastic. Oh, I've got some more pens here if anybody needs them. Fear character sheets, yeah. All right. And then the other rat goes rushing up to Valentine. Because Valentine was a weapon her sword around earlier. And he's like, ooh, even though she didn't hit me, she's still a bit dangerous. And so he rolls to attempt to bite you. One, he could completely fail. Trips on his way over and falls flat on his face and doesn't even get to bite you. All right. So we've got Mabel and Sully have actually tied for initiative. So who's got the highest dexterity? You've got one. That's down the other group. Not out of Mabel and Sully. No, you don't want. No, you don't want. Okay. So Mabel goes first. What would you like to do? Hit them. Hit them, yeah. So you've got your axe. That's probably the best option. Yeah. So yeah, roll to attack. Okay. Nine, nine plus five is 14. Oh, you did it. Yep. You attack with your axe. So now you get to roll your damage, which is a D12 and this one plus three. You make a lot of damage. Barbarians are very good. Yeah. 13 damage. You split that right into that right. You just was like, oh, before. And the rats just gone. Oh my god. Yeah. Mabel is very, very strong. Yeah. All right. Next is Sully's turn. Yeah. What would you like to do? There's one rat left to have been killed. And one of them has a harassing grip. Catch it in the back. In the back, it is how big a new? What is your rat? You're the dragon mort actually. No, you're pretty big. So that's okay. But the rat is the size of the big dog. It's very big. You don't have a bag big enough to put the rat in. Okay. Cut it. Cut it. You could. So if you would, if you would like to keep the rat as a pet, then you would have to roll animal handling, which is one of the skills to attempt to calm down the rat. You can do that if you'd like. Yeah. So here is, yeah. Here's the dice. So roll your dice. Why? I want a pet. You can give a pet. You can do whatever you like. One. Unfortunately, you're attempt to pat the rat. You go up and you're like, it's all good. And you attempt to pat it and it bites you on the head. So you take two damage from the rat biting you on the head. So just here, you have a hit point of 11. So now you have to take away two. Yeah. There's still one rat in the line. There's still one rat. Yeah. Okay, Sheila, it's your turn. Yeah. Yeah. Are you going to attempt to kill the rat? Yeah. Yeah. You're going to attempt to pat the rat. All right. Do you want to attack? What do you want? How would you like to attack? Uh, in the bowl. Yeah. Yeah. So here's the dice. Well, 10. Okay. And then you have your plus damage. The plus next to it. Um, it's like plus two. Are you both plus four? Oh, okay. And then you have a 1D6 plus two damage. So 14 to hit hits. And then the D6 for your damage. 1 plus two. Okay. So you hit him with your arrow and he staggers a little bit. But then he's like, oh, he's still good. He's still alive. But he's looking a bit shabby. He's looking a bit sick. All right. So we're back to the top of the round and it's Valentin's turn. Um. Okay. You want a viewer? That's a viewer's choice. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So you're hitting it with your sword? Five plus five. No, no, hang on. No, unfortunately you miss again with your sword. Yeah, you're not doing too well down here. Are you Valentin? But at least you were the person who alerted everybody to the rats. So you know. Everybody has their skills. Okay. Next we have Griff. Your turn again. What would you like to do? There's one rat alive in the room and he's right in front of you. Which does mean unfortunately he's too close to you. You're bowed. Can I leave it away? So if you, because he is right next to you in your spot, if you move out of that area, he will try to attack you. It's called an attack of opportunity. So your option is to either attack him unarmed. And I'm behind someone. Unfortunately, if you go to move out of the way to hide behind someone, he will attack you. So you can either attack him. I will. I attack him. Yeah. You punch him in the face? Beautiful. Yep. You hit him and you do three damage and you indeed kill him. That was it. That was the last of his hit points. You just punched that rat to death. Okay. So you've killed the rats. You've achieved the job. Here we go. Okay. Now you look through the hole in the wall to see where the rats are coming from. Because there may be more rats. The guy said that you needed to make sure that you kill them all, which means you have to have a look through the hole. Through the hole in the wall, you see a dusty stone corridor. Its floor is lying about a foot below. So it's a step down into the corridor. Over to the left. You can see the start of a staircase buried in collapsed stone that blocks the way completely. To the right, the passage heads around a corner. But on the wall, you can just make out what appears to be some writing and glowing gold script on the wall. So I'll reveal a bit more of the map now that you've gone through. So you can see here that's the collapsed staircase. So you can't go down that way. But down this way you see something a little bit mysterious on the corner. What would you like to do? We wait for Mullen and have the meeting to congratulate and who killed the most of the rats. You can attempt to do all that meeting. Everybody doesn't need to do that if they don't want to. Also, you can still hear a faint squeaking of rats, which means you haven't quite finished the job. There's probably some more rats down here that need taken care of. Okay, so let's see where the rats and I just shoot them. So you want to go through the hole in the wall and down the corridor? Can I see them? I need to go through the hole. Yes. Okay, so you go through the hole and the wall and you start to go down the corridor. You see from the edge of the corridor, you see one of the rats dot out and it tries to run away from you and it runs around the corner to this area here. And it's right here on the floor is a beautiful tiled mosaic. Do you guys know what a mosaic is? It's... It's like a beautiful image made out of tiles. So it looks like this. So each of these are just like little tiles. Let me Google what a mosaic is. Yeah, so it's like when you make a picture out of little tiles? Yeah. So on the floor is this beautiful mosaic of tiles and this is what the picture is. And so the rat runs along the floor and a big blade comes out of the wall and chops him in half. What you've got here is a classic trap. Anybody who's going to step on this mosaic could get caught by the big blade. And past there though, you can see down the hallway, you can see lots of doors down here. So something interesting is down the hallway, but first you're going to need to figure out how to get past the trap. Can I go back and ask them the one who people could build the beard? Yeah, okay. One second, I'm just going to read to you what is written on the wall in the glowing golden scrap. Dawn breaks with stirring air as sun shines down on a new day fair. Midday blazes, blaze bakes earthen grass, the farmer waits for heat to pass. Evening cool brings water, wine, drink and laughter, passing time. Night sea shining, roaring fire as wood and coals burn on the pyre. So the passageway continues to the left and ends with two doorways. So the mosaic shows the sun, the sky and hillside and a river. The mosaic is a trap and standing on the wrong portions on the floor will cause a large blade to slice at any trespasser. So if you guys want to continue down this super cool ruin which definitely has treasure, you have to figure out how to get past the trap. Yes. And so this gives a clue on where you can step. The stirring is for heat to pass. Maybe we need some heat here in the middle of the lens. Is there any some drinks and lakas? Is that? I think water, wine, drink and laughter. Any some water? We can put some beer here. Well you can't get to this one until you walk across these ones. First of all, you need to figure out the first one. You can see each clue relates to each part. Don't break this green air. Obsolution don't renew the air. Can I go back to ask a waiter? Absolutely. Do you go back to ask Glow-Kennel about the mosaic? Yeah. So these guys continue looking at the puzzle. You go up and ask him. He's like, oh, we've never managed to go through the hole in the wall. I've never seen it. Sorry. Worth a try? Stirring the air. Stirring the air with my axe here. So you swipe your axe over to stir up the air above the mosaic? You do? Yeah, just in this area. Yeah, nothing happens. Can I use my fork? Yeah, you can use your sword to stir up the air above it. Unfortunately nothing happens. Can I just join the air together? I use forward to shoot the one of the mosaics. Mosaic? Yeah, you could just say tiles. You shoot it with your bow? You shoot it with your bow? The arrow hit the ping-pings off? Whereabouts? Do you shoot? Do you shoot this section? I think this one. You shoot this section here? Nothing happens. I shoot the grass. The blade comes out and goes, oh shh. The blade comes out and goes, oh shh. Should the sky? Oh, so? You shoot the sky. Nothing happens. So I move forward and stand up here. I use the sky bit. Yep, nothing happens. You're fine. I use forward to shoot here. One second. Oh, you use your fire breath weapon? Yeah, so do you use that just to cross here? Do you wait till Griff is standing in the way? I get wet in the way thing. Okay. So you make sure you don't hit Griff but you breathe your fire weapon over the mosaic. Nothing happens. Oh, it seems like we have one to shoot parts. And we need to shoot the right part and the blade won't... Yes, yes. I think you're on the right track. Yeah, okay. So, wait for the heat to pass. And I use the ball to shoot this part. The blade comes out, oh shh. And you're now out of arrows. Oh. You've used up all your arrows now, unfortunately. You don't have infinite arrows. Oh my gosh. So you can go back into the other room to collect your arrows out of the dead rats if you want. But, yeah. Can I move the dead rat's body? So you'd like to pick up the dead rat body and throw it on to the... Yeah, why would you like to throw it? The blade is as it owns. The bottom arm waits for heat to pass. Waiting for heat to pass. I threw the body to here. The blade comes out, oh shh. Just like cards. Do we need to go through one by one or just one next to one? The tension from four. So what's happened so far is he tested each of these panels and this one was safe. Now, if we look at here, it says, dawn breaks with stirring air as the sun shines down on the new day. So now, if you look at this clue here, it should tell you which bit is safe to stand on. Oh, so I first stand here. And then I... I know that. I will move forward with you. You move forward to there? You're safe. Nothing happens. You're all good. And then I move forward to here. You're directly moved here. Wonderful, perfect. You're perfectly safe. It's all good. What? Green is one. Green is one. You're on the water. And I see shining. Shining. Rolling. And then I go through here. You're totally fine. You step on there and nothing happens. No blade comes out. So I... You successfully made it. Yeah. Oh, I know. Oh. Yeah, so you've all made it to the other side of the mosaic. The tile floor, well done. But, you know, obviously be careful. Don't step back onto it. Okay. So now, you can see here, there's two doors. Would you like to go inside? Yeah. I go to left one. Go left one. So this one here, the one straight ahead. Oh, this one here? Yeah. Okay, so you're going to that room? Hang on, I just need to check it. Okay, yeah. So now, you're in this room here. Just like a... Okay, so you do all go into the room? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Everyone goes into this room here? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. The door opens onto what once might have been a lab or a work room. To your left sits a desk and the shattered remains of glassware, while the centre of the room has a set of tall bookcases with lots of books in them. All around, however, are scorch marks and sounds of countless little fires and the air is filled with a smell of smoke and burned meat. The wooden furniture is blackened and burned in places while what may once have been a pile of books has been reduced to ash. As you enter, you feel something crunch beneath your feet and you glance down and realize it's the charred remains of a giant rat. Oh no. So it might be a patented... Yeah. So you're walking into the room. Are you just walking in? Are you sneaking in? Or I'm walking in. You're just walking straight in. I'm just walking straight in. You're just walking straight in. Oh, shit. Everyone needs to roll initiative. Okay. Four. Four. Okay. Oh, seven. Yeah. Oh, that's good. Oh, 19 plus. Oh, 18. Oh, you're going negative. Yeah. Oh, 18. That's good. 19 plus. Oh, 18. Oh, you're going negative, yeah. Oh, 18. That's good. Plus two. Oh, that's very good. Oh, no. Two. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, you walk in and Sheila is the first one to spot in the corner, and the corner is the top corner of the room. And the top corner is the giant spider. Wow. And that spider, it's mouth is glowing with flames. What would you like to do? Run away. No, I want a tag. A tag? Beautiful. Yeah. A tag? Beautiful. Yeah. Do you want to run? Thank you. Oh, beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. And then, so, what do you have to write? I think you're a D6 to, to feed a damage. Five. Yeah. Beautiful. And plus four. So, should say, one D6 plus two. Okay. It's five, six, seven. So, you do seven. Indeed. Okay. Is there anything different about the spider? The spider gets hit straight in its neck with an arrow. And it's like, oh, but it doesn't look like it was damaged at all. It still looks quite healthy. That's the wrong one. Yeah. You definitely feel like this spider is a lot scarier than the rats. Yeah. Okay. So, next is Sully. Okay. Okay. Give me four wires and pat it. So, you would like to pat the spider? That's one more good with that. Now, unfortunately, the spider is still up in the corner of the room. So, you wouldn't be able to reach it with your hands. So, but something you can do is if it is your turn and you're not sure if you want to attack yet, you can hold your action. So, you say, I'm not going to attack until the spider attacks. And you can say that if you'd like. Okay. All right. So, you're going to hold your action to attack if the spider attacks you. Okay. Who do we have next? Next is the spider. Okay. Please don't. Yeah. I'd be afraid. Okay. So, the spider is going to shoot a burning web out of its butt. Is that where the spider's web has come from? It comes out of the back, doesn't it? All right. So, it turns around and shoots a flaming web straight at Griff. Okay. Is it the first line in the room? Yes. It's because you came running into the room first. All right. Okay. So, 7 plus 5 is 13. What's your armor class? It's beautiful. So, the web hits you. It doesn't do any damage. So, it doesn't hit you directly, but it still catches on your feet and you're now restrained by flaming webbing. So you can't move at the moment. I know. Okay. A bit of the spider stays up in the corner. It doesn't move. So, next we have Griff. What would you like to do? Run away. So, you can attempt to use your action to make a DC 12 strength check to burst out of the web. So you'd like to do that? Okay. So, was that 4? Yes. No, unfortunately, what's your strength? 2. Unfortunately, you only made 6. You didn't make 12. So, you are still stuck in the web and now you've used your action to attempt to escape. So, that is your turn. Next, we have Valentine. I want to use my frost spell. Oh, okay. So, you want to cast your frost spell? 13. Oh, definitely. You definitely smack that spider straight and it's torso with your frost spell. Yeah. And that's a 1-D. 1-D8. So, where's the 8? Okay, it's losing up this one. So, that was your damage? 3 damage. But because it's a flame spider and you cast a frost spell, he's particularly sensitive to frost and we're going to double the damage. So, you did 6 damage. Okay, next we have Mabel. Yeah. What would you like to do? See we. You can, if you would like, because you are very strong. If you would like to roll to break, to pull Griff out of the web and free him, you can. So, if I say if you're working with him, you're going to say it here. Okay, so roll a strength pack to pull Griff out of the web. You owe me some money, remember that? 3, your strength is a plus 3. Oh no, you've got a plus 5. That's still only 8. Unfortunately, Griff is still stuck in the web. Oh, it's quite a full strong. So, we're back up to the top to Sheila. It's your turn. I think you can keep this one. That one's your only one that you need, sir. What do you got? 12 plus what? With your plus 4, 16. Yes, you hit the spider. Uh-huh, of course. 5. 5, oh, 5 plus 2. So that's 7? Yeah, 7, another 7 damage. Okay, now he's starting to look a bit woozy. He's starting to look a little bit slower, despite his limping a little bit. He's got two arrows sticking out of him. One of his legs is frostbitten from the frost spell. He's starting to look a bit more sad. So next we have Sally. Yeah, is that fine? I can't see. He's still on the ceiling, unfortunately. So you can't get up to him, but you can hold your actions to pat him when he comes down, if you'd like. I'm not talking at first and once he gets down, I'm happy. So you can say, so how holding your action works, you can say, I'm going to wait till the spider comes down off the roof, and then I'm going to pat him, which means, which means the spiders turn his next, and if he comes down, you'll immediately be allowed to have that go. It's because it's triggered by that action. Okay, you'd like that. So next is the spiders turn. And in fact, he does come scuttling down from the roof to come to you, because he only had one flaming web spell, so he's coming to bite you all now. So he climbs down from the roof into the middle. So now you can attempt to pat him, because he's down on the floor, which you like to roll animal handling. So there's your dance there. Well, there you hold him. 14, not bad. What's your animal handling score? And you know what, weirdly? Zero. Zero, so 14 total. So you walk straight up to him. He's a bit confused. And you pat him gently on the head. And you know what? He kind of likes it. He's like, he's fun. He's like, oh, he just kind of, he's like, oh, you know what, a cat's like, and he like rubs his little head into your hand. He really has that option. Yes, you can do whatever you want. Okay, so that's your turn. The spider does not attack, because he's too busy being padded, which means it's now Grif's turn. Grif's gonna, leave the web for you. What was that? Six, six, six, six, six plus four, ten. No, he's still stuck in the web. Grif's having a rough time in the web. Okay, Valentin, what are you gonna do? Are you still gonna attack the spider? Even though he seems like he's having a nice time now. Yeah, I want to do it. You can do whatever you want. I still want to. You still want to attack it? Okay, so you're gonna use your sword or your frostbale? Yeah, frostbale, yeah. Fifteen, yep. You definitely hear him, so you'd be eight for your damage. Eight damage. Ooh, so you definitely... Okay, so he's looking not good. He is looking very, he's looking very much like one little poke with a dagger is gonna finish him off. He is not doing well. So, next we have Mabel. If I let the spider to fight a little bit, or me, will I attend to the spider? I think you could give it a go. You don't know. You don't know whether you're gonna get magical spider hows or... No, the spider is really weak. I think the spider can't get any harm to me. Okay, so you're gonna walk... Are you gonna walk straight up to the spider and hold your armor? For a bite? Is that what you're gonna do? Just one finger out. For a bite. Alright, so that's what you do with your turn, but we'll have to wait for the spiders to find out. Okay, so... We got Maru woman from the Moon Master. So, back up the top, Sheila. Are you gonna end the madness by killing the spider? Or are you just gonna... Yeah, I'm gonna kill it. I'm gonna kill it myself in the locker. Okay. Alright, 15. You definitely hit the spider. Two plus two's for damage. You shoot the arrow, boom, straight into one of his big weird eyeballs, and he collapses to the ground. The spider is dead. Oh, that's it. But you can show the way that being downed works in D&D. It's like when you kill something, you can attempt to stabilize the creature, so you can roll medicine to attempt to stabilize and save him. Would you like to do that? Yeah. So we're out of initiative, because the creature is down. So you can just try to do that if you'd like. So here you go. You're gonna roll? You're not saving me that. You are still stuck in the web. Four. Ooh, and watch your medicine score. Yeah, unfortunately, you attempt to manage up the poor spider, and no, he dies. Unfortunately, yeah. But you gave it a go. You pat him on the head one last time. Yeah, that's it, unfortunately. Okay, what would you guys like to do? You're in this room with the spider? Do you want to have a look around? Do you want to go through this door here? Do you want to go back through this door here? What would you like to do? You want to have a look around? Beautiful. So what you do to have a look around is you roll the dice and you add your score for investigation to investigate the room. Two, that's not right. You're not thinking of it in five. Five, oh, that's a really good score for it. So seven, that's not too bad. So you have a look around the room. And you see that actually, one of the books looks like it's not as damaged as the rest. Would you like to check out what that book is? Yeah. Beautiful. So you notice that this book is a wizard spell book and it contains the spell's detect magic, identify an arcane lock. And because you're a wizard, you can actually use that book. That's really good. So you can write down that you found a wizard spell book. What? Oh, you can write it. Usually, I would write a hymn in features and traits. You can write down that. That you found a wizard spell book. That, would you like me to just send it to you as a message? A word was spell book. SP? Yep, SP, ELL book. And it has detect magic. Identify. And arcane lock. Arcane is ARCA N-E lock. Yeah. So you can learn those spells from that spell book. So if we were going to play again, you could look up what those spells are. And now you have three new spells. Beautiful. Does anyone else have a bit of a look around? Or does anyone help Griff get out of the web? What about me? Do I guess I'm super power? The spider did not bite you. Oh, okay. Unfortunately. So no, no, so, but worth a go. Maybe we haven't finished exploring. Maybe there's more spiders. You might throw spiders off. You absolutely can. Would you like to collect some of the spiders' body? Maybe, like, he's fangs that have poison and stuff. And you can use those to make potions later. Yeah, definitely. So you're going to roll. You should roll either medicine or nature. You can pick which one you'd like. I pick whichever one you have a good score in. Which one? I. Medicine or nature. Nature. Nature, beautiful. Roll, nature. Four plus. The hero. Four plus here. Oh, nature is one. Okay, fine. Okay. So you go to extract some of the spiders' fangs. You pull them out. You don't do a very good job of it. So like, you try to get out of it. You rip some little bit and you lose a bit of the poison. But when you finish up, you end up with two little vials of poison that you could use to maybe coat your arrows in or coat your sword in to do extra damage later. So yeah, good job. Anybody want to help Griff get out of the web? Yes, it's your turn. Do you want to roll to get out of the web? Wonderful. You're out of the web. Griff manages to free himself from the web. All right. Do you guys want to check out any of these doors here? Can I go over the store? Absolutely. So you want to go through this door here and check out what's in this room here? Do you want to go with you? Yeah, good idea. All right. So we're going to go into this room here. All right. You can flip. You guys are doing this out of order. That's a little bit. Okay. In the center of the small room ahead of you is a large stone well topped with a wooden handle and the rottenen remains of a heavily frayed rope that descends down into the well. In the far right corner, the ceiling has collapsed a little bit. And a small little weak shaft of sunlight comes through the narrow hole. To the far left is a plain wooden table crusted with dirt and dust and laden with old plates and buckets and other strange pieces of tableware. Do you guys like to have a look around? Yeah. Yeah. All right. So I'll have everybody roll perception. Have a look around the room. 15. Hmm. Which part are you at? Ah, so your perception. Yeah. Ah, you can. Oh, that's a very good perception view. You go over to this table here and you have a really good look at that table and you realize that those old plates are actually made of silver. Okay. And once you clean them up, you could sell them for 50 gold. Okay. Okay, are we starting to simmer into gold? No. But I actually don't know if you can do Alchemy in this game. We can look it off. Okay. So you guys are just walking around the room. You know, you're just having a look around. Okay. You hear a clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. And out of the well, pops a giant centipede. Let me get a image. This is essentially gold. Yeah. He's had pokes over the double. And he's looking at all of you. Okay. So roll initiative. Oh, deal. No, my engine is in the shape of a fork. And plus what? What's your initiative score up the top a little bit? Yeah. Plus one? Monest one. You're a year before. 10. 10. And oh, she was quick. 14 plus 1. 3 plus 2. I use my love for the rest of the web. It's like that sometimes. I don't know. I don't know. Actually, she got some really cool poison out of those. I have a friend who every time we kill someone, he's like, and now I take all the body parts and we're like, oh. Maybe the web can be used to catch some other end. Yeah. You can do whatever you like. I'm going to give it a big for what? Oh, behind us. Okay. Well, not yet. Okay. Because you're still in this room here. To do Mabel. You go first. What would you like to do? So the center being poked his head out of the well. But he hasn't done anything yet. Can I talk to him? You can try. So I haven't put on your character sheets because I wanted to keep it simple. But you guys will know like different languages. The dwarves speak dwarves. Dragonborn have their own language. Elves speak elves. But you all speak common. So you all speak the same language. You can talk to each other. But yeah, if you'd like to chat to the center being, give it a go. I don't ask why are you here. What do you want? Okay. You say why here. What do you want? So the center being can't respond to his turn. So the next person's turn is Sheila. What would you like to do? So you can either wait to see if the centipede responds or you can do something else. Keep in mind, if you'd like, you can hold your action to attack until the centipede responds to the question if you'd like. Yep, hold your action. Not a problem. Okay. So it's the centipede's turn. He looks at Mabel because Mabel spoke. And then he makes a clicking noise and he launches out of the well advice you want the arm. You're not so friendly. I don't like him. You don't like him. Okay. So he is going to attack. Three. Three. Yeah. He goes to bite you on the arm but he misses. He doesn't. He doesn't hit. Yeah. So Sheila, would you like to attack? You would you like your action that you held because the centipede clearly was not friendly? Yeah. Okay. So you can attack now. And then he's just chance to be like, who are you guys? Oh. Unfortunately, you go to shoot at him but you miss. Yeah. Okay. Who is next? Valentin. I want to attack you. Okay. You attack him wonderful with your sword or with your frost spell. Yeah. Beautiful. So 11. 11. That's five. That's five. Yes. You get him. Yeah. So roll your damage. Four. Just four. Okay. Beautiful. Doesn't do double damage this time. He's not as sensitive. Okay. So next we have Griff or Sully. Who has the higher dexterity? You've got negative. Yeah. So Griff first. What would you like to do? I've already collected the silver. Right? I mean, yes. You've got the plates tucked away in your bag safe and sound. Okay. I'm running away. You run. Absolutely. So you actually don't need to roll from for that because you weren't close enough to the centipede. You can actually just run out of the door. That's fine. You don't need to roll. Okay. So in combat, you only have those you thought of movement per turn. So each of these squares is 10 is. No, I think it's five foot. Yeah, five foot. So you were standing here at the plates. So you've got five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty five, thirty. You made it to just outside the door. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Sully, it's your turn. I want to do the information to make. Yeah. So you can do that. So what you do because you're a dragonborn. So you can just go straight up to the centipede and roar in his face to try to scare him. Okay. So you go up and you roar straight in the centipede's face and you say, where is that treasure? I can't be a beautiful roll intimidation. You can't be loud. All right. What's your intimately? What's your intimately? Four. Two, six. Okay. So you're like, where is that treasure? And the centipede's like, oh no. Oh no. And then the centipede backs down the well a little bit. So he was a little bit scared but he hasn't run off yet. So he backs away, which means he's no longer like right at Mabel. Okay. So I'm the closest one. You are the closest one. Yeah. I'm the closest one. I'm the closest one. I'm the closest one. I'm the closest one. You are the closest one. Yeah. Okay. But he has backed off a little bit, which is good. Okay. So if you wanted to run away now, you can. So she's scared of just enough to get him away from you. And it is now your turn. I'm thinking the centipede does not speak. Yeah. Based on, you're always worth of go to have a chat to see if they'll talk. But if they don't, sometimes it's just, yeah. You certainly can, yeah. Okay. So he got just with your axe. Yeah. Yeah, good. Cool. It sounds beautiful. Yeah. You smack that centipede straight in the head with your axe. And that's your D12 for your damage. Oh. 15 damage. Yeah. Really strong. Yeah. He's dead. So you're like, oh, buff with your axe. And he's like, oh, let me hear you in a full and you splash. You have a centipede hitting the bottom of the well. Okay. Yeah. What would you guys like to do now? So you've explored this room. You've explored this room. And there's like one more door in this room where they had the spider that you didn't go through. Would you like to check that one out? The body of the centipede has fallen down the well. Would you like to try to climb down the well to get the body of the centipede? You would. Okay. So I'm going to need you to roll an athletics check to see if you're strong enough to climb down the well. One. Okay. A one is often just an automatic failure. So you go over the side of the well and try to climb down and like, woo! And you guys hear, so they go, woo! As he falls, woo! And you fell into the well. And you take three falling damage. Oh my goodness. Yeah. But you know, you're like, oh, yeah. You're like, oh, yeah, you're head a bit. At least that's right. But you are down there. Can you what? What's the big bathroom? Well, do you have any potions in your infantry? I don't think I've given you guys any. Do you have any healing spells, maybe? You do. Yeah. Oh. Five. Yeah. Yeah. So per long rest, you can give anybody, if you touch them, including yourself, five health points. So yes, you can heal yourself if you'd like. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, add, add however many up to five that you'd like to heal. So you, I guess you just add those three points back. Well now you stuck down the well. Are you going to still try to harvest the centipede pieces? Yeah. Okay. So you, you prize open the centipede's mouth and you notice that he has like some pretty, like here's his, his a picture of him. I actually found the picture. I have a bit of it. So he has some pretty intense little looking pinces. Would you like to roll nature to attempt to harvest those, the poison from the pinces? Yeah. Oh, six. And then plus what is that? Major. Yeah, one. One, seven. You do a better job of this than you did with the spider. And this time you get three little vials of poison. It's up there. It's poison. I know. You have to do this. This one's different. It's a little bit weaker. It's a weak poison. Whereas the spider was a stronger poison. Okay. Well now you're in the well. Do you attempt to climb back out? Yeah. Okay. So roll enough. Let it check to climb back out. Okay. So roll enough. Let it check to climb back out. But this time you help you use the rope to help you. Sixteen. Sixteen. Wonderful. You get out of the well with no problems. You don't fall this time well done. I'm going to let you drink that spider point in a way. I guess I'm super powerful. You can drink the spider poison if you don't like it. I guess that's just one way to find out. So what you could do is you could roll. I'll let you roll. You don't have good. You can roll medicine to investigate the poison. To see if you know whether you die. Okay. So yeah, you can roll. Yeah. Roll medicine to investigate the poison. Ten. You investigate the poison. Do you think there's probably a good chance it will make you sick if you drink it? I'm not sure. Is there any superpower in this world? Not from animals biting you. But you can get you can be cursed. Or you can be like you can get you can get special powers. But not from animals biting you as far as I'm aware. But the good thing about this game is you can kind of make up whatever you want. So if we kept playing and you were like I would like there to be super powers in this world. Then the DM can add that in. Wow. You can actually have whatever you like. But yeah, you need to like the DM can go away and prep that information and make it so that the super powers in this world if you want. Can I drink a little bit just a little bit? Would you like to? Yeah. Okay. So you are going to take a tiny, do you let her take a tiny sip of your spider poison? I'm so sorry. Actually, I was going to give you all five gold each to start off with. So if you'd like down here you can see there's like a GP for gold pieces. You can write five for five gold pieces. If I guess I'm super power out of safety. Just a little bit. I won't buy. Just a little sip. Thank you. Okay. So you take a little sip of the spider poison and you're going to roll a constitution. Oh, 14 plus four for a constitution save because you're pretty tough. You take a little swallow of the poison. You take a little swallow of the poison and you don't feel very good. You feel a little bit woozy and you're like, oh, my tummy hurts. Oh. And you lose three hit points. Why? You're just trying poison. I get it. You still feel a bit so new. Yeah. So what happens is every time you take a long rest you get all of your hit points back. So usually every day when you go to sleep at night you get all your hit points back. So don't worry too much. I have your blood. Do I need... Okay. So you need to minus three hit points. So you're down to 12 hit points. But you also do notice that you are feeling like a little bit stronger after that. You're actually like, oh, it's almost like I've taken a bit of that poison and now my body is a little bit more resistant to poison. Like a vaccine. So now you may write down resistance to poison. That's cool. Yeah. So not quite a superpower, but not bad. All right. Would you like to run medicine to take some of her blood? If she lets you. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Are you going to let her harvest a bit of your blood now that you're... Are we going to develop a vaccine for poison? What's going on here? Ooh, very good. 19. She... She... She puts it like a tiny, tiny little mick in your wrist. Holds a little bile underneath and collects a few drops of blood. She is so gentle. You don't even feel it. Okay. Very good job. Okay. What would you guys like to do? Do you want to investigate the last room? Yes, you do. Yeah. Okay. So you walk back through the spider room and you open this door here. I assume you're all walking in together. And we'll reveal this last room here. Okay. It's a storeroom. The rear wall of this small room is lined with sturdy looking wooden shells. Clearly, these were once laid in with bottles and glass vials. But over the years, many of these have been reduced to shards of glass on the floor. There's a flicker of movement among the wreckage and you see a small black rat lapping up the last remnants of liquid left... Left in the shattered remains of a dark blue bottle. What do you do? Search the whole room. Search the whole room, yeah? Yeah. You've won one taste of treasure in now, yeah. 13. So that's perception. Perception. Perception is two... Two, 16... Oh, 17. Oh, 16. 16. So you have a good look around the room and you notice that the potion that the rat is currently drinking says, potion of enlargement on it. Apart from that, there is also a handful of bottles still on the shelves, including two potions of healing, a potion of invisibility, and a potion of vitality. So you can write those down as loot if you would like. Oh. So that's... You can write it wherever, so like there's like you can write it in equipment or just just put it all in the big box usually, where I have it. So two potions of healing. And... A potion of invisibility. And a potion of vitality. I actually don't know that one. It removes poison. Yeah. So a potion of vitality, if you've been poisoned, you can take it and it removes poison. Okay. So what are you going to do? So you've just walked into the storeroom. You've had a look. You've all had a little book of a look around and I'd like you to all write down one potion of healing. You've all found one potion of healing each. And you've also noticed a small little rat who's currently drinking up a potion that smashed on the ground. And that potion says, potion of enlargement. Oh. Well, I was trying to get my guard around the way. So when I'm drinking, I'm drinking the... He's... He's drinking up a business. Yeah. Yeah. I've put the poison onto the rat. Oh. Oh, you got it. What do you do? I want to wrap that poison. Oh, wait. Uh, okay. Can I run that poison on drink? Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah. the potion of enlargement. Okay, you can, but I will note that it's been smashed and you would have to lick it up off the ground next to the rat. I don't care, because it's not actually a new rat. Okay, would you like to get down and lick up the rest? Yeah, I would get down and kick the rat away and lick the enlarged portion. Okay, so Griff suddenly kicks the rat, kneels down and starts to lick up the potion of enlargement. I'm just going to remember how big you get. And after that I drink the invi-lo-billette is cool. Okay. Why don't you keep the juice out? Dude, if you do that, you won't get your reward. All right, so you start to drink the potion of enlargement and all of a sudden, because there wasn't enough left. You only got a little bit. There was only a little bit on the ground. Suddenly you get a three-feet taller. So you're now nine-feet tall. You're here. And that effect will last for three hours. Okay, and so do you kill the rat or do you just leave the rat? I will pour the poison into the potion. You'll pour the poison into the potion. What do you call it? Oh, I see it. No, no, no. Oh, okay, so you pour a bit of poison down for the rat to drink. Okay, so I'll get you to roll a slight of hand to do that without scaring the rat off. Whoops, whoa! You're really good now. I roll again. Okay, nine plus your slight of hand, which I think is three from the bottom. Make good one. Okay, so eight. Okay, so you pour a few drops down and the rat skade off for a little bit, but then when you move away, the rat comes back and starts lapping up the poison that you pour down. And then a few seconds later, he goes, any dies. And that was the last rat. You guys have cleared out the rats. Yeah. So what would you like to do now? Would you like to go back and get your reward? Yes. Okay, so you walk out of the cellar and Glowkindle is waiting anxiously by the trap door. He asks you. He's like, oh, guys, how did it go? Perfect. Perfect. He goes, oh, my god. I feel like you weren't that big when you went in. No. Oh, my. So all the rats are gone. Yeah. Oh, fantastic. Did you find anything interesting while you were down there? Spiders. Spiders. Yeah, I have two more things I want to silly. Oh, well, you know what? You've done such a good job. I'm going to let you keep whatever valuables you found down there. Okay, wonderful. So he each gives you 25 gold pieces each. He also gives Sully because Sully asks for extra reward. Gets a plus one. What do you, where you're appalling? You're like that. Yeah, a plus one sword. So if you write that down as your loot, a plus one sword. And everybody gets a hundred XP, which means you're all now level two. Oh. And yeah, if we play again, I can help you upgrade your characters to level two. There's a bit of stuff involved, but that's not too much. But yeah, that's it. All right, so I'm going to stop the recording.
